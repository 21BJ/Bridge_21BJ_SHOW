## What is it:
<a name="waht-is-it"></a>
<p> 
  The bridge is a set of smart contracts that allows users to insert their assets into the game locally. <br>
  In practice, this section consists of a series of smart contracts that bind users' assets into a smart contract and control the procedures for returning and binding users' smart contracts. <br>
  When a user inserts assets into the "Bridge" the data is inserted into a list, the assets are bound and an event is triggered that sends the information to the "BackEnd". <br>
